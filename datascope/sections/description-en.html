The paper ‘Data scopes for digital history research’ [1] introduces the concept of
"data scopes" to alleviate a lack of transparency and replicability with regards to
the data manipulation steps in historical research. Data scopes are proposed to
"characterize the interaction between researchers and their data and the transformation of a cluster of data into a research instrument".
<br/>
This ontology defines an machine readable format for data scopes to further increase transparency and reproducibility by allowing for (semi-)automatic analysis and replication. It also
moves the model even more towards the FAIR principles, making the data scopes
a method to publish data manipulation steps as findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. 
<br/>
The central concept of a "data scope" describes a view on research data as well as the process that results in
this view. The process is inherently iterative and includes modelling decisions, interpretations and transformations on the data. The datascope takes shape through five activities:
<ul>
<li>Selection: which data and sources are selected? This matches the process
of forming a corpus for a specific research question.</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>Modelling: how are the relevant elements in sources represented? With the
increased use of digital tools, these models become more and more explicit.
</li>
<li>Normalization: how are surface forms mapped to a normalized form? (e.g.
the mapping of person names to a "Firstname, Lastname" form.)
</li>
<li>Linking: what explicit internal and external connections are established?
This includes actions like deduplication, named entity resolution etc.
</li>
<li>Classification: how are objects grouped or categorized? This includes categorization using internal or external schemes or theories.</ul>
